One of my colleagues often writes code in irb, and modifies it a bit.

This code captures the methods, classes, and modules defined in irb and
stores them with exactly the same style and indentation they were entered.

Even comments are saved! Well, actually only provided they are
*inside* the method or class instead of before it.

How to use
bc.  console
  $ irb
  >> load 'irb-hack-tf.rb' # or irb-hack-no-tf.rb
  >> # work, work, work... look at CLASSES, METHODS and MODULES
